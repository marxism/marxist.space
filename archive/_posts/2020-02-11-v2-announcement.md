title:  "Announcing marxist.space v2!"

This project began as a bunch of bookmarks copy-pasted into a site.
What was initially a one-page list of categorized links is now a moderately-sized,
and growing, collection of pages, and it's getting harder and harder to quickly
find relevant resources for a given topic.

So we've decided to redo the whole thing!
We're building a complete new app with many planned features to allow folks to
more easily find what they're looking for. We want to make it possible for
someone to get on [marxist.space](https://marxist.space) with a thought like
"I want to watch a documentary about the GPCR" and instantly have links
available. We also want to build a way for you (or for us) to find good
sources to back up claims during discussions.

The new app will feature a tagging system, (hopefully) intelligent search,
and eventually system for showing excerpts of sources for quick citation.
We'll be keeping simple, plain-text data storage so anyone can
[put in an issue](https://github.com/marxism/marxist.space/issues) to add
a resource.

The development is happening all in the open, so feel free to check out
[the project](https://github.com/marxism/marxist.space/projects/1) and add
your suggestions or contribute!
