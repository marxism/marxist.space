A [ProleSoft](https://prolesoft.github.io) project.

## Adding Resources

First please search `db.yml` to make sure what you want to add isn't already in
there. If it is, and you couldn't find it because the tags were incomplete or
incorrect or the title or subtitle were incorrect, please change those instead.

Otherwise, add your links to the top of `db.yml` under the line `resources:`.

This is the type of a resource:

```
interface Resource {
  href: string
  title: string
  subtitle?: string
  tags: string[]
  excerpts?: string[]
}
```

An example would be:

```yaml
resources: # this line is already there, needs to stay at the top
  - href: https://example.com
    title: Example Domain
    subtitle: It's an Example # subtitle is optional
    tags:
      - best
      - website
    excerpts: # this list is optional
      - This domin is for use in illustrative examples in documents.
```

## Developing

Prerequisites: Node LTS or Latest, npm, Docker, Docker Compose

```shell
git clone git@github.com:prolesoft/marxist.space.git
cd marxist.space
npm run install-all
npm start
```

You can also develop without Docker. You'll need Node LTS or Latest and npm.
**Note** this is not recommended, running with Docker Compose is easier.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:prolesoft/marxist.space.git
cd marxist.space
npm run install-all
# Edit proxy in package.json to be http://localhost:9090
cd server
npm start
# In another terminal
cd client
npm start
```

Go to <http://localhost:3000>

## Building and Running

```shell
npm run install-all
npm run build
cd server && npm start
```

Check out <http://localhost:9090>

See [this doc](./scripts/deployment/README.md) for details on deploying, running
